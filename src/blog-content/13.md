[Studying human progress](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/) is a pretty new (formalized) thing, and humanity's rate of progress has never been more unbelievable to me. Here's a list of some major events:

**4 bya** - Last universal common ancestor
**600 mya** - 1st multicellular organism - [Ediacaran fauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ediacaran_biota)
**540 mya** - Cambrian explosion
**300 mya** - Carboniferous where coal deposits come from (Lycopods)
**66 mya** - Non-avian dinosaur extinction
**250,000 ya** - *Homo sapiens*
**10,000 ya** - Crop cultivation
**2,600 ya** - [First coins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croeseid) used as currency
**500 ya** - 90% of work done by humans and animals (animate power)
**400 ya** - Coal passes biomass energy source in England
**200 ya** - Biomass still supply more than 98% of all heat/light
**150 ya** - World's primary energy (crude oil) extraction started
**140 ya** - Commercial electricity generation
**121 ya** - Wright brothers' Kitty Hawk flight
**117 ya** - Plastic invented
**55 ya** - Apollo 11 moon landing
**35 ya** - [World Wide Web](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) invented
**27 ya** - WiFi invented
**12 ya** - CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing
**2 ya** - Turing Test undeniably beat by open-source AI models

**50 yf** - oil and gas reserves run out
**90 yf** - Uranium-235 reserves run out
**120 yf** - coal reserves run out
**?? yf** - Martian colony established
**?? yf** - All GHG-producing industry moved off-earth

We've had [bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bread) for only .00035% of our evolutionary existence. Capatalism (.000065%), electricity (.0000035%), plastic (.000002925%), and wifi (.000000675%). Most things in my daily life are insanely new.

Four things are obvious:
1. Predictions into the future with a defined horizon will probably be wrong. Even the natural resource predictions are based on currently known reserves. They keep getting pushed back as new reserves are discovered but there is a not-so-distant upper limit on how far they'll be pushed off
2. Building B2B/C SaaS companies feels wrong given where humanity is going
3. Making something important for human progress—like energy, food, supply chain, transport, etc. systems—feels right but requires capital
4. Maybe building SaaS companies for the capital makes sense

Is this the Builder's Dilemma?
