I feel no satisfaction. Classic Huberman dopaminergic curve. This took 16 days from idea -> Testflight. Finished -> deployed was mostly me operating at 10% capacity after burnout + random first-time app deployment mistakes that I'll never make again. Twirl, which I started in the Armada Venture Cup on Saturday is almost ready for Testflight, taking ~1.5 days. Maybe I'll feel it when I hit our first organic user. Or after a launch party but that would probably be pseudo-satisfaction. Or after $10K MRR. 

Been fully MIA trying to read *[Principles of Neural Design](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262534680/principles-of-neural-design/)* but only a few pages in. I'll try to crack at it a bit harder this week.
