I'm a bit iffy on what to spend my Ithaca summer doing—should I fully lock into [Verdus](https://verduslabs.com) or just [jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Me_by_Your_Name_(film)) into gorges and [frolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_(film)) in the meadows? But this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCR-WPuE_UA&list=TLPQMjgwNTIwMjXZTgZGXFVqWA) just reminded me to just do it all because when else will I get a chance? (*Love everything / fear is the mind-killer*) Humans realized this thousands of years ago but we've had to constantly rediscover it. I'll probably forget this but will find it again in a few months, years.

My current summer bucket list:
1. Make a cornhole set with wood
2. Make a chair with wood and [Ithaca shale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesee_Formation)?
3. Make a [Mölkky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6lkky) set with wood (My new Finnish friends + the Finnish ambassador to South Korea that I met in Seoul taught me how to play)
4. Play three actual songs with guitar
5. Make three paintings
6. Make a LLM Necklace that observes audio + video 24/7
7. Make a robotic humanoid talking head like an annoying parrot
8. Get three paid clients for Verdus

Did I miss anything?
