I heat frozen fruit with greek yogurt many mornings. I realize while I'm heating my fruit, the music playing on my AirPods starts glitching and stops. But when I walk farther from the microwave, it starts playing again. What causes this interference? Apparently WiFi, Bluetooth, and microwaves all use 2.4 GHz. A microwave has power to heat stuff up because of the high wattage and concentration chamber that bounces around the light. That's making me think more about information flow/[interference](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)â€”it's insane how much stuff is going on that we have no idea about.
