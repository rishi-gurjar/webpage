I met with \[redacted\] yesterday and I smashed it. If *degrees from Elon* is a heuristic for the level of who I'm speaking to, I've hit the 2-3 degree range. But while walking back I was like *fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck bitch* *ad infinitum* for like 12 hours afterwards, reliving every moment and thinking how I could have changed something I did.  

I know I wasn't scared or anxious before or after the meeting—channeling anxiety into excitement really works—but I think I'm just scared of success. Scared of what might happen if the wins keep happening. Instead I just choose to self-sabotage—the best way to avoid the feeling of success. 

If it's not my *id*, most of the [death-drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive) is driven by my *superego*, especially after wins, thinking of what I did and whether it was socially right. The *ego* is too weak to stop the wrath of the *superego* after wins, preventing the übermensch and retaining the comfort of mediocrity. At least I'm aware of it more now despite heavy internal resistance.
