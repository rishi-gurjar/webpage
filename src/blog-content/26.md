Well-designed unprofitable products are all over the place. Highly profitable shit-designed products are all over the place. 0.0001% of products fit both. Great engineering is great design. Just look at a [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_(spacecraft)). That's why the engineering teams are placed right next to design and manufacturing at Tesla. Are they mutually exclusive? Does no one want to make the world beautiful?
