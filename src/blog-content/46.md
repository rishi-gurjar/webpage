I've heard "courage is in even shorter supply than genius" everywhere. It reflects everything I've seen at college and elsewhere. Intelligence is abundant but agency is scarce. I don't know why no one tries. It's easy to game optimization problems like college apps or college classes but impossible to game making something useful. That's why the video game *Entrepreneurship* is so fun.

This 1/99 distribution makes inequality seem inevitable and [Great Man theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory) slightly less bs.
