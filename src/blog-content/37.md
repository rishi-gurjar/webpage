I miss the [Clover Food Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clover_Food_Lab) in Cambridge and their H2O 69F, H2O 42F, and H2O + CO2 taps. And their rosemary fries. And their falafel. Not the panini though. Saw it on Tony Chen's latest LinkedIn post and got flashbacks. Maybe if I hit $10K MRR I'll finally be able to make the move out there. Thinking about it while I wait for Armada House Dinner.
