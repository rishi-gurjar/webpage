title: Starting a blog

Starting a blog for three reasons. First, Aaron Swartz had a [blog](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/001622) and it's cool as fuck. Second, Mark Zuckerberg had a blog in *The Social Network* and it's pretty cool. Third, I need more validation of my opinions and an overengineered blog is much better than my X. Cursor did most of this; I take barely any credit. (See how I used that semicolon?) My entire biological neural network solely operates to press "Tab" nowadays. And trying to look back at this in a long time and cringe, similar to my "forty seven" Blogspot blog back in the day.
