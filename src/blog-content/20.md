I rediscovered Virgil Abloh's [Tumblr](https://virgilabloh.tumblr.com/page/412); I'm reminded of the Boston summer I spent scrolling through all 467 pages. His come-up from creative directing Donda to founding Off-White and designing for Louis Vuitton is fully documented in a series of spontaneous observations captured by his phone. 

I was talking to Ronald about taste as we were trudging up to North campus in the snow last week and it became obvious that taste is the product of seeing a ton of work and self-assessing it. If you see hundreds of paintings—on purpose or not—and make small mental labels, you can develop a taste for "good" paintings. You'll know what you like the *instant* you see a painted surface. I did (and continue to do) that accidentally—just because I find stuff cool—and common features of anything I look at have become intuitive to me. Like [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds) when I paint or take photos—no need for me to pull out a ruler... it's just obvious. 

If people are born (mostly) *tabula rasa*, and taste is acquired through expanding the (labeled) dataset for our biological neural networks, how can you develop *distinct* taste? If you look at what everyone else is doing and copy the stuff you like, is it truly new? Tarantino does that with his films but I wonder if that is how major leaps are made. Everything is technically a derivative of something before and you can Markov chain your way back to the old cave days. You don't even need to go that far: iPhone, the archetype of a revolutionary product, can be traced to the [Newton MessagePad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_iPhone#:~:text=13%20Further%20reading-,Genesis%20of%20the%20iPhone,was%20able%20to%20convince%20him.). Is the best strategy for making products that truly revolutionize the way humans interact with the world consuming as much stuff on X as possible (disgustingly easy for me) or sitting in a cave and consuming nothing and just thinking?

To develop taste a little more intentionally, and because I like [visual stuff](https://www.gracekasten.xyz/), I added cool artwork to the top of my blogs. I also might hack together a Photo-to-Blog Tumblr clone so that people have a way to look back at the early days. I can't question the heavenly mandate but it's clear that the feeling is in the air.
