I am watching a [painting en plein air](https://youtu.be/1M_BSbHRfwY?si=vowC6sgvoIzkeh9J) in my dorm alone wishing I was in Pacifica. Everyone has gone home. You would expect everything to be grey. Grey buildings. Grey dining halls. Grey libraries. Grey dorms. But everything is more beautiful than ever.

It's snowing outside. I feel the heat of the furnace on my feet. My window is open. I hear screams outside and think a girl is being stabbed. I ignore it, *it's probably someone overreacting*. I hear more screams...*wtf*.

I stick my head out of the window into the snowy air and see people snowball fighting on the slope. Rare sight. I get a snowflake on my eyelash. *Should I join in?* I shut the window and roll back into bed.
