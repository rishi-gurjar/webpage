Trying (unsuccessfully) to study for finals. Classic. 

On Sunday, NTRES 3100 was surprisingly easy. A same-day 8 AM - 12 PM study session for a 1 PM test worked super well. That has never worked before. Pro: good grade. Con: my hubris has been boosted to new heights even though my previous track record of studying suggests I should start a month—not a day—in advance. 

ECON 1110 should be easy but I said that last time too. MATH 2940 has taught me it's best to leave technical stuff to smart people... PLSCI 2410 was supposed to be a breeze but the second prelim surprised me by being short answer. I went into it thinking it was going to be multiple choice. Smart. ECON 3801 is a hit or a miss. I thought I'd be on top of the readings but I realized my mind cannot understand the English from a textbook but loves the English from Wikipedia. 

When I have a final approaching, the subject feels incredibly dull. But as soon as the final is over, it suddenly becomes fascinating again. Can I make that a razor?
