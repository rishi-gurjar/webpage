Studying organizational structures...

**The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra**

The conductor directly communicates with each orchestral musician directly. No information is passed through an intermediary.

**Early Facebook**...yes that is Dustin Moskovitz

Early Facebook—like any startup—had direct communication between Zuck and all other members of the team. Hierarchy made no sense.

René Redzepi, the head chef, had a head of R&D and sous chefs but maintained direct connections will all members of the Back of House (line cooks, prep cooks, probably even dishwashers) and even Front of House since he is the co-owner/CEO.

Steve Kerr coached all players directly. No one stood between him and the players.

**Braindead**
The trend is obvious. The most effective teams in the world regardless of craft are led by individuals who directly engage with all members. Why aren't all teams like this? Kind of braindead. Brian Chesky would go crazy.

This was [CDJ](https://cornelldatajournal.org/)'s organizational structure after I reformed it this semester. E-board is working pretty well and the editorial team is working beautifully. So beautifully that this is the most productive semester of all time for the club. But there is a dislocation at the PL-Analyst level. They are currently separated from me with a layer of hierarchy and it isn't working well. Looking at the structures above, it's clear that direct connection to all team members is vital for success. So I must do that.

We'll see how this goes. Observe & Act type shit. It's so braindead but I forget sometimes.
