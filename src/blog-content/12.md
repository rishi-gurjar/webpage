In 1985, Steve Jobs was "immensely jealous" of Alexander the Great. Not because of his military conquests but because Aristotle was Alexander's personal tutor. Anyone can read Arisotle's works but no one can ask him a question.\

“My hope is someday, we can capture the underlying worldview of Aristotle - in a computer. And someday, some student will be able not only to read the words Aristotle wrote, but ask him a question - and get an answer.”\

I thought it would be interesting to recreate Aristotle and some other thinkers, but using a locally running Llama-3 model. Even though the thinkers' spoken and written ideas—stored as word vectors—may not be an accurate representation of their thoughts, it's much more interactive than reading an old work like *[The Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato))*.\

The reason a lot of old philosophical works are called "Dialogues" is because they're written as conversations between several people. The ancients knew that ideas explored through a back-and-forth discussion were the most powerful. Explore some ideas with your personal tutor, Aristotle, [here](https://rishigurjar.com/ancients).
