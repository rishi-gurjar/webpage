Saw this on [Titter](https://x.com/foundertribune/status/1901285950015066237). Not a typo.

There's always a unrelenting chronic superego reversion-to-the-mean pressure. Reversion to Goldman-Google pressure. The most virtuous thing one can do is resist that pressure even if the Matrix sends its best agents to stop you. I feel it. It's hard but that seems to be what it takes to do the most important work in the world. 

Successful entrepreneurs romantically look back at their early days when they were broke and grinded all day. When they just ate ramen and slept on a mattress on the floor. When there were no obligations. That's where I'm at right now but theres a chronic unsatisfaction until $10K MRR is achieved. And then [$100K MRR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Pain). Then $100K DRR. But people always say to enjoy the journeyâ€”but if it's all downhill from here it'd be rough.
