I went to Yale's annual hackathon a few weekends ago. I did absolutely no "hacking" unless you count rewatching *The Social Network* ELO algorithm scene 20 times.\
\
Will and I met a ton of people while we were scouring for Celsii (many Celsius's) and we retreated to a room with a chess set. While playing a game, we met a few Yalies and they tempted us with a proposition. Ditch the hackathon and just meet cool people. We decided to follow them around campus. Compared to Ithaca, New Haven seemed like utopia.\
\
People were actually outside chilling. It's crazy. Even a few CS majors we met weren't worried about recruiting. Everything came to them like they were bears in a river waiting for salmon. We felt like the salmon.\
\
I lost a game of cornhole in Saybrook and saw happy faces. The night went from a student band playing the Arctic Monkey's Arabella (giving me an unsolicited reminder of high school) and pumpkin spiced Eden to a castle siege with minor casualties. Don't ask.\

Chance decisions lead to crazy outcomes. I don't know why we didn't do the hackathon but it seemed to work out. My big takeaway is always look for Celsii.
