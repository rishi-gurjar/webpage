I'm thankful to be born into an inefficient world. 

A world where problems are not solved as soon they appear. A world with a ton of poverty, ecological problems, societal issues, etc. We're born too late to explore the world and too early to explore the stars but this still seems like the most exciting time of all time (a bit biased). There are so many major leaps that are within arms reach.

We're still pre-Singularity. After intelligence explodes, human intelligence will be primarily non-biological, and we'll be in a world of abundance. The transformation from human -> machine intelligence has already started. Our current tertiary-layer cyborg form (phones are a part of our bodies) will seem cute. People will look back at todays rate of technological progress and it will look like a flat line (true on any point on an exponential). 

The world may cease to be inefficient but that seems impossible from our current position. It seems impossible to think that there would be no problemsâ€”would people just scale up the hierarchy of [needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) until everything is meaningless? The only thing left to do would be to find better questions to ask.
