I've had three roommates in my Gothic double for a few months. The third is a bat. Unlike Drew's room, it is stuck in a locked cabinet. 

I first heard small squeals and sweaks but I thought that was just Rahul. After ruling out that hypothesis after days of intense observation, I told him about it. He heard the bat too. We decided to investigate. 

One of our windows is always open to suppress CO2 and the gusts of air shake the cabinet. Every shake causes more squeals. He asks me to *tap the cabinet*. I say *fuck no*.

He relents and taps the cabinet and the sweaks grow louder. There is no way I'm going to open that cabinet. I'd much rather avoid and forget. This is much worse than those beetles we see all the time.

So we avoided. And now my room smells like a dead bat. I hope the bat was just in my head.
