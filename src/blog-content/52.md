I wish there was a pebble.

A pebble that listens to all conversations, plays music, and executes calls. That's all I need. It just needs a microphone and speaker. 

I'd be able to view my photos, configure playlists, and see the intelligent outcome of the recordings on my computer. I use social media/browse the web/text on my computer anyways and take photos on my smart glasses. What else do people use their phone for?

I'd be able to throw the pebble around, fidget with the grooves with my fingers, and skip it on a slow pond. And if our civilization collapses, future archaeologists would never find the technology. Since it's hidden in a pebble.
